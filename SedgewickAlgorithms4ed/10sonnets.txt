from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beautys rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feedst thy lights flame with self-substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makst waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beautys use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self-love to stop posterity
thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beautys legacy
natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
which used lives th executor to be
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never-resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty oer-snowed and bareness every where
then were not summers distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beautys effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
then let not winters ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beautys treasure ere it be self-killed
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
thats for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self-willed for thou art much too fair
to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his new-appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
so thou thy self out-going in thy noon
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well-tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none
is it for fear to wet a widows eye
that thou consumst thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beautys waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murdrous shame commits
for shame deny that thou bearst love to any
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovst is most evident
for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee
